### Run on macOS-arm64
Note: These steps below only need to be done once.
1. Open terminal, navigate to this directory: <br>
`cd <path_to_this_folder>`
2. Enter `chmod +x minesweeper` to make file `minesweeper` an executable.
3. Open `minesweeper`. <br>
At this point, MacOS will make a prompt saying this is from unidentified developers. Since this game is as clean as me playing Fantasie Impromptu, proceed to step 4.
4. Open `Security & Privacy Settings`, click `Open anyway` on `General` tab.
5. Try opening `minesweeper` again. It should work this time.
6. Enjoy!
