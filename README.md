So as not to accidentally mess up `main branch` later on, one should follow these rules:
1. Create a new branch for each new feature.
2. Commits should be clearly named base on the their content. It is best for each commit to include **one** change in code only.
3. Make a `pull request` when a branch is done coding and ready to be merged into `main`.
4. Before merging a branch to `main`, be sure to carefully check if the merge is safe (i.e., make sure that the merged code works fine).
5. Comment on the `pull request` if there are any thoughts or stuff that need fixing.
6. Raise an `issue` if there are bugs.
7. `Issues` can also act as a reminder for any feature or task that needs to be done.
8. Last but not least, be sure to `fetch` and `pull` main branch regularly, in case there are any changes made by others.

I guess that's it for now. Have fun coding ^^
