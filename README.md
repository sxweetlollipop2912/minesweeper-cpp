## Features
Minesweeper is a childhood game of any windows user. Besides general rules, here are some other stuff:
- If all bombs surrounding a cell have been flagged, `double left click` on that cell to reveal the rest of surrounding cells.
- Number of bombs is always 20% the size of custom boards.
